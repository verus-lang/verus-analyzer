Verus-analyzer is a version of [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) that has
been modified to provide IDE support for writing [Verus](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus) code 
and proofs, including syntax support and various IDE features.

## WARNING!
This software is **experimental** and subject to change; some features are likely broken.
At present, it works best on small, self-contained Verus projects.  Anything more complex
will likely fail.  You may file issues, but we do not currently have dedicated engineering
support for `verus-analyzer`, so **your issue may not be addressed**.  Pull requests with
fixes are always welcome, although it is unlikely they will be reviewed immediately.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

The main requirement is that `verus-analyzer` expects you to "Open Folder..." on
a directory containing a standard Rust project layout and metadata (`Cargo.toml`) file.
`verus-analyzer` scans the project root (`src/lib.rs` or `src/main.rs`) and all files
that are reachable from the root. If the file you are working on is not
reachable from the project root, most of the IDE features like "Go to
Definition" will not work. For example, if you have a file named `foo.rs`
next to `main.rs`, but you do not import `foo.rs` in `main.rs`(i.e., you haven't added
`mod foo` in `main.rs`), then the IDE features will not work for `foo.rs`.

As mentioned above, `verus-analyzer` also expects to find a `Cargo.toml` metadata file,
as is in standard in Rust projects. For a small
project, you could start by running `cargo new`, which will automatically generate a
suitable `Cargo.toml` file for you. For a larger project, you could use a Rust
[workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html) to
manage multiple crates.

### Installation

Please install the `verus-analyzer` extension via the Visual Studio Code extension marketplace.

## Features and Details

### 1. Verus Syntax
We extended rust-analyzer's grammar for Verus-specific syntax. This means that it highlights reserved Verus keywords (e.g., `spec`, `proof`, `requires`, `ensures`). If a user types `prof` instead of `proof`, a syntax error will be generated.


### 2. IDE features
You can find more documentation of the IDE features by following these links.
- [Go to Definition](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#go-to-definition)
- [Go to Type Declaration](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#go-to-type-definition)
- [Find all References](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#find-all-references)
- [Hover](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#hover)

#### 2.1 TODOs for IDE features
- Code scanning is incomplete for Verus-specific items. To be specific, `requires`, `ensures`, `decreases`, `invariant`, `assert-by-block`, and `assert-forall-block` are not fully scanned for IDE purposes (e.g., you might not be able to use "Go to Definition" on a function mentioned in a `requires` or `ensures` expression, or "Find All References" might omit occurrences inside `requires` and `ensures` expressions).

- Although Verus' custom operators are parsed, they are not registered for IDE purposes. For example, type inference around such operators might not work (e.g., `A ==> B` is parsed as `implies(A, B)`, but the IDE might not be able to infer that `A` and `B` are Booleans).

- `vstd` is not scanned by default; if you want to enable "Go to Definition" or auto-completion for `vstd`, you should add it as a dependency in your Cargo.toml file, e.g.,
```
[dependencies]
vstd =           { git = "https://github.com/verus-lang/verus" }
builtin =        { git = "https://github.com/verus-lang/verus" }
builtin_macros = { git = "https://github.com/verus-lang/verus" }
```

### 3. Running Verus

Each time you save a file in your project, Verus should run and report proof failures and warnings in the IDE.

#### Extra Arguments
To pass extra arguments to Verus, add the following table to the `Cargo.toml` file for your Verus project:
```
[package.metadata.verus.ide]
extra_args = "......"
```
where the quoted string is a list of space-separated Verus arguments, e.g., `extra_args = "--rlimit 20 --log-all"`.

#### Advanced Verus Developments
Some advanced Verus projects (e.g., those making changes to `vstd`) may need to use `#[cfg(verus_keep_ghost)]`
in their Verus files.  This will cause various `verus-analyzer` features (like Go To Definition) to stop working,
since `verus-analyzer` won't recognize that `cfg` setting by default.  To address that, edit your VS Code `settings.json`
file to add:
```
    "verus-analyzer.cargo.cfgs": {
        "verus_keep_ghost": null,
        "debug_assertions": null,
        "miri": null
    },
```
In the future, when we sync up with the latest version of `rust-analyzer`, you will need this setting instead:
```
    "verus-analyzer.cargo.cfgs": [
        "debug_assertions",
        "miri",
        "verus_keep_ghost"
    ],
```
since `rust-analyzer` changed the type it expects for this setting.

---
## Limitations
- This is experimental software and subject to change.
- It is intended to be used only for Verus code. 
- Multiple features of `rust-analyzer` might be broken or missing.
- Syntax might not be updated to the latest version of Verus.

## Misc
- The `verus-analyzer: Clear flycheck diagnostics` command can be used to clear the error messages in VS Code
- The `Developer: Reload Window` command can be used to reload VS Code and the verus-analyzer server instead of closing and reopening VS Code
- Setting `"rust-analyzer.diagnostics.disabled": ["syntax-error"]` in your workspace's settings can disable the syntax error messages in VS Code. You could also add `unresolved-module` to the above list to disable the error message for unresolved modules.
- There is no proper support for `buildin`/`vstd`. However, in your project's `Cargo.toml` file, you can add `vstd` in `dependencices` or `dev-dependencies`, which might make `verus-analyzer` scan `vstd` and `builtin`. For example, you can try adding:
```
[dependencies]
vstd = { path = "../verus/source/vstd"}  # assuming verus and the project are in the same directory
```

## Proof Actions

[Proof actions](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/bparno/papers/proof-plumber.pdf) 
are an **experimental** feature to assist developers when debugging proof failures.
They show up as light bulb (ðŸ’¡) icons in the IDE when you hover over a failed proof.
They are designed to automate many of the tedious, error-prone debugging steps that 
developers previously did manually.  See below for some examples.  The framework
is also designed to make it easy to write your own proof actions.  Indeed, the
examples below only require ~30-180 lines of Rust code.

### Proof Action Demo

### Currently Enabled Proof Actions

The "Hover over" column indicates where you should place your mouse cursor 
so that a "light bulb" ðŸ’¡ will appear and allow you to perform the corresponding
proof action.  In the examples linked to below, the `$0` characters indicate
where the user has positioned their mouse in the "before" version of the code,
and below you can see the version after the proof action executes.

| Hover over | Proof action | Examples |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| `assert` keyword | Move the current expression "up" one statement in the current function, adjusting it appropriately based on the statement it "moves past" (technically it applies one weakest-precondition step).

| `assert` keyword | Take an assertion containing a `forall` quantifier and an implication and introduce a [`forall ... implies ... by` statement](https://verus-lang.github.io/verus/guide/quantproofs.html#proving-forall-with-assert-by) where the quantified variables are in scope and the proof already assumes the left-hand side of the implication. | [code](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus-analyzer/blob/55279b828ea54a79916b528567f3919f6eac6fc0/crates/ide-assists/src/handlers/proof_action/intro_forall_implies.rs#L98) |
| `assert` keyword | Take an assertion containing a `forall` quantifier and introduce a `by` clause where the quantified variables are in scope. | [code](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus-analyzer/blob/55279b828ea54a79916b528567f3919f6eac6fc0/crates/ide-assists/src/handlers/proof_action/intro_forall.rs#L71) |

| `ensures` keyword | Introduce a failing ensures clause as an `assert` statement at the end of the current function | [code](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus-analyzer/blob/55279b828ea54a79916b528567f3919f6eac6fc0/crates/ide-assists/src/handlers/proof_action/insert_failing_postcondition.rs#L92) |
| `ensures` keyword | Take an ensures clause `A ==> B`, and move `A` to the requires clause, leaving `B` in the ensures clause. | [code](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus-analyzer/blob/55279b828ea54a79916b528567f3919f6eac6fc0/crates/ide-assists/src/handlers/proof_action/split_imply_ensures.rs#L75) |

### Developing Your Own Proof Actions

We encourage you to enhance the proof actions above and to develop your own proof actions.
Pull requests are quite welcome.  Here are some steps to get started.

1. Each of the proof actions linked above lives in an individual file in this [handlers folder](./crates/ide-assists/src/handlers/proof_action).
2. Find the existing proof action most similar to your idea and copy it into a new file in that directory.  Update the names and code appropriately.  Note that each proof action is called on just about every single UI event, so it's important that your proof action exits quickly and cleanly when it doesn't apply.
3. Add your new proof action to the long list in the `all()` function in the [ide-assists' crate's `lib.rs` file](crates/ide-assists/src/lib.rs).
4. Follow the steps in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to build and test your new proof action.
